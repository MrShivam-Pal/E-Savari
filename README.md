E-Savari: An Integrated Public Bicycle Sharing System

Problem Statment : The problem of urban transportation has been a major issue in many cities around the world. With the increasing number of vehicles on the road, traffic congestion and air pollution have become major concerns. Public bicycle sharing systems have emerged as a popular solution to this problem. However, each bicycle sharing system operates independently, and users have to download multiple apps to access the bicycles. This creates a fragmented user experience and makes it difficult for users to find available bicycles. Additionally, many bicycle sharing systems require users to manually enter their payment information, which can be cumbersome and time-consuming.

Solution : To address these issues, we propose the development of a web application called E-Savari, which integrates data from multiple public bicycle sharing systems and provides a seamless user experience for finding and using bicycles. The application will allow users to view the location of available bicycles on a map, reserve bicycles, and unlock them by scanning a QR code. Payment information will be stored securely in the application, and users will be charged automatically based on the duration of their bicycle use.The goal of this project is to provide a convenient and sustainable transportation option for urban residents, and to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution in cities. By integrating data from multiple bicycle sharing systems and providing a seamless user experience, we hope to encourage more people to use bicycles for transportation and to promote a healthier and more sustainable way of living.
